WeatherScrapeR

The package is designed to scrape weather data from wunderground personal weather stations (PWS) for a single or multiple days. Documentation is based on The Weather Company APIs for personal weather station contributors; as such, this does require the use of an API key. You can get a wunderground API key by connecting a PWS to wunderground and generating one on their website. Current functionality is for historical data, although over time I plan on updating the package to scrape multiple stations into a single data frame.
